  // Deliberately the SSH form, not package.json's own git+https:// repository field (that field stays https://; it is public consumer-facing metadata, unrelated to how this release pushes). semantic-release first tries a dry-run push to repositoryUrl as written and uses it when that succeeds; only when it fails does it rewrite the URL to https with GITHUB_TOKEN embedded, which cannot bypass main's branch ruleset and is rejected. The Release job's checkout persists no credentials: the deploy key is written to disk by a step immediately before semantic-release and handed to it as GIT_SSH_COMMAND, so the dry-run authenticates over SSH as the key, which the ruleset lists as a DeployKey bypass actor (see .github/workflows/ci.yml, which also dry-run pushes first so a missing key fails before any publish instead of reaching the token fallback).
